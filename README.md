VMathLib (Vedic Math Library)
============================
This project is for implementing Vedic Math techniques for solving various mathematical problems like multiplication, 
division, roots, trigonometric functions and their inverses, polynomial and bipolynomial functions, calculus etc. in a way 
that are quite different from conventional methods. These are modified for supporting very large operands and giving high 
precision results, that are not supported by standard Java Math library. Calculation of "Cross Products" is what 
differentiates Vedic Math. Hence, power and multiplication have time complexities that are a function of the number of 
digits of the operands and not their magnitudes.
Strings have been used to generate the complete results, otherwise left to right calculation is used for only the specified 
number of significant digits.
This repository only contains a part of the project source code.Rest of the methods will be merged later. This project will
be further expanded and continuosly modified for helping reduce the cost of computation with other speed maths techniques,
time, memory and energy wise. This project will also be written in various other programming languages like python, C, C++,
perl etc. to extend the benefit to as many developers as possible who need high-precision at the software level for 
scientific. financial or other applications.
