VMathLib (Vedic Math Lib)
=========================
This project is for implementing Vedic Math techniques for solving various mathematical problems like multiplication, 
division, roots, trigonometric functions and inverses, polynomial and bipolynomial functions, calculus etc. that are 
quite different from conventional methods. These are modified for supporting very large operands and giving high precision
results, that are not supported by standard Java Math library. This will be further expanded and continuosly modified for
helping reduce the cost of computation with other speed maths techniques.
